**Executive Summary**

The exercise plan outlined in this report is designed to aid recovery for individuals diagnosed with Cancer Cystitis. The plan is tailored to the individual's current health status, physical capabilities, and recovery goals. The objectives of this exercise plan are to improve physical function and mobility, reduce symptoms, and enhance overall well-being.

**Understanding Cancer Cystitis and its Impact on Physical Function and Mobility**

Cancer Cystitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bladder caused by cancer treatment. This condition can lead to a range of symptoms, including urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. The physical impact of Cancer Cystitis can be significant, leading to decreased mobility, fatigue, and reduced quality of life.

The recovery milestones for individuals with Cancer Cystitis include:

* Improved bladder control and reduced urinary frequency
* Increased mobility and reduced fatigue
* Enhanced overall physical function and well-being
* Reduced symptoms of pain, discomfort, and anxiety

The physical therapy goals for individuals with Cancer Cystitis include:

* Improving bladder function and reducing symptoms
* Enhancing mobility and reducing fatigue
* Improving overall physical function and well-being
* Reducing symptoms of pain, discomfort, and anxiety
