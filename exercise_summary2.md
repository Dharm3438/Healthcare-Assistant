**Understanding Bladder Cystitis:**
Bladder Cystitis, particularly Interstitial Cystitis (IC), is a chronic condition characterized by bladder pressure, bladder pain, and sometimes pelvic pain.

Patients often experience flare-ups that can limit their ability to engage in physical activities. 

**Recovery Milestones and Physical Therapy Goals:**
1. **Initial Recovery (Weeks 1-2):** Focus on gentle stretching and mobility exercises to alleviate discomfort and improve flexibility.
2. **Intermediate Recovery (Weeks 3-4):** Gradually introduce low-impact aerobic exercises to enhance cardiovascular fitness without aggravating symptoms.
3. **Advanced Recovery (Weeks 5-6):** Incorporate strength training and pelvic floor relaxation techniques to build endurance and support bladder health.
