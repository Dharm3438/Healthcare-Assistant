# Comprehensive Diet Plan for Potts Spine Disease (Tuberculosis of the Spine)

## Nutritional Requirements
1. **High-Calorie Foods**: Patients require energy-dense foods to combat weight loss and muscle wasting.
2. **Protein-Rich Foods**: Essential for tissue repair and immune function.
3. **Micronutrients**: Vitamins and minerals, particularly Vitamin D, Zinc, and Iron, are vital for immune health and recovery.
